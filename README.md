# Cubli
The Cubli project is an attempted recreation of the Cubli engineered by ETH Zurich. I was
drawn to this project for the mechanical and software challenge. Because of this, I treated
this project more as a learning experience rather than pushing for a final product. Most of the
progress made on this project was on the mechanical structures of the project before I
dropped it. Unfortunately, I never made significant progress on the electrical or software
systems of this project as I was focusing on team projects during the time period of the Cubli
project.
